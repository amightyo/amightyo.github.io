# Hello! I'm Dr. Mighty Itauma Itauma
With over a decade of experience in higher education, I have cultivated a dynamic career that bridges the worlds of academia, leadership, and analytics. As a Professor of Analytics and Division Chair of MSBA and DBA programs, I have had the privilege of guiding numerous students through the complexities of data-driven decision-making. My journey began with a deep fascination for how data can transform industries, and over time, I’ve channeled that curiosity into developing cutting-edge curricula, mentoring future business leaders, and overseeing program growth and development. My work extends beyond the classroom, as I regularly chair dissertation committees and collaborate on program oversight and improvement initiatives to ensure academic excellence.

I am passionate about the intersection of education, technology, and leadership. Whether it’s on the pickleball court or the ice rink, my extracurricular pursuits have shaped my approach to teaching and mentoring. Both sports demand strategic thinking, agility, and resilience—qualities I bring to my work life. These activities teach me how to remain adaptable, foster collaboration, and continually strive for improvement, principles I apply to guiding students and colleagues toward academic and professional success.

Looking ahead, my research interests focus on the application of machine learning and analytics in higher education, particularly in improving student outcomes and institutional effectiveness. As I aspire to take on greater leadership roles, such as Dean of Academics or Vice President of Academics, my goal is to inspire a new generation of leaders in academia and beyond. I am open to collaborations on research projects, innovative curriculum design, and leadership initiatives that drive meaningful change in the educational landscape. Let's connect and explore how we can shape the future of education together!
