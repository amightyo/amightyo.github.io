- Preparing you for the Job market.
- Learn the basics of Java and how to write good programs.
- I want you to learn to think Computationally.
- Learning how to collaborate with your colleagues. 

## Prerequisite 
- No prior programming experience.

## What you'll learn  
- At the end of this mock class, you will know the basic concepts in programming.  
- The secret of the Black-Box.  

## Mock outline  
- Getting to know you! (2mins)  
- Introduce yourself to your partners [(Kahoot!)][kahoot]. (3mins)  
- Mock Labs (Blockly). (15mins)  
- Basic concepts.   (20mins)

### Creating a Project using Codeboard (Programming in the Cloud)

- [**"A web-based IDE to teach programming in the classroom"**][codeboard].

[codeboard]: https://codeboard.io/

- **_Beyond Hello World, Java Comments, Variables Primitive operators, Increment Operators, Strings, Getting User Input_**


### Mock Quiz

- Back to [Kahoot!][kahoot]
- **Hands on challenge** > Implement a method using codeboard in Java that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit respectively. These methods take in a parameter as input and return the results. The variables passed to the methods should be initialized in your main method (_you may also ask the user for the input_). The results from these methods should be printed out in your main method.
