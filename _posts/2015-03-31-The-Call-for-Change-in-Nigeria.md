## Change! Change! Change!

This word currently reveberates across Nigeria. The people are awake and have initiated a transformation that seemed impossible within the last 16 years. A great revolution indeed! This transformation is being projected with the objective of redirecting the country towards greatness. In gratitude, we rejoice that change can truly be experienced.

Let it be known that we are the change we seek. It is high time we woke up, strengthen our zeal and commitment to direct the nation lovingly. Now is the time to get back to the drawing board and support our new leader as he works towards restructuring the nation. It is a process that should be experienced with sincere understanding. The gate to success is in the hands of the leader and followers. One cannot work without the other. 

I congratulate Nigerians as we embrace change!

The flag is divided vertically into three equal parts:  
The outer parts are green, and they represent agriculture.  
The middle part is white, and it represents unity and peace.

Long Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria!
